description: Our first prefabricated modular housing project in Australia. This is a granny flat located in Brisbane, covering 80 square meters, with 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and 1 living room. The highlight of this house is its spacious design, featuring a ceiling height of 3 meters and a living room width of 6.5 meters. These dimensions are unimaginable for most granny flats and prefabricated modular houses and even surpass many standard residential homes.
