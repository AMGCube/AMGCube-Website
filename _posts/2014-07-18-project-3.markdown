description: Made of high-quality SMC material with a smooth, baby-skin-like touch, it effectively retains heat from air and hot water, ensuring a warm and comfortable bathing experience in winter without cold feet. The advanced hydrophobic surface allows water droplets to roll off quickly, keeping the surface dry. The SMC nano-coating provides 90% anti-mold efficiency and excellent antibacterial properties. The waterproof base features a raised edge design and integrated molding to prevent leaks entirely.
